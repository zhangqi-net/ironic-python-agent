    Fixes failure to detect a hung file download connection in the
    event that the kernel has not rapidly detected that the remote
    server has hung up the socket. This can happen when there is
    intermittent and transient connectivity issues such as those
    that can occur due to LACP failure response hold-downs timers
    in switching fabrics.
