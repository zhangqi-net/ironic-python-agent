    Provides timeout and retries when establishing a connection to download
    an image in the ``standby`` extension. Reduces probability of an image
    download getting stuck in the event of network problems.

    The default timeout is 60 seconds and can be set via the
    ``ipa-image-download-connection-timeout`` kernel parameter. The default
    number of retries is 2 and can be set via the
    ``ipa-image-download-connection-retries`` parameter.
