    Fixes the short timeout retries interval, which was previously ``5``
    seconds, to a length that will allow the agent to retry after a
    network interruption. The time between retries is now ``10`` seconds,
    and the number of retries are set to ``9`` to help ensure intermittent
    network outages do not cause recoverable failures.
